          <p>
            I am a Full Stack Web Developer, Certified Scrum Master, and a
            foreign medical doctor. Five years ago I and my family moved to the
            USA, just after I finished my internship and started to practice.
            When we came to a new country, I was fascinated with the
            possibilities that the tech industry offers here. When medicine and
            technology bind together, they can create something unbelievable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same impulse that led me into the medical field in my earlier
            career has led me to IT: the moment of discovery when pieces of a
            puzzle fall together, excitement when you found a good solution. I
            am investigative, driven to make a difference, motivated to work as
            part of a team to diagnose and solve complex problems. I am
            experienced in highly detailed work with no room for error and can
            communicate complex information to team members and clients.
